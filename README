Be sure to install the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) prior to compilation.

To compile, type "make".

This program takes in the structure of a TCR-peptide-MHC complex, containing only
TCR variable domain and MHC alpha1-alpha2 domains. Also, it assumes the naming 
convention for the chains:
A: MHC
B: MHC second chain (if Class II)
C: peptide
D: TCR alpha chain
E: TCR beta chain

THe output from this program includes re-oriented structures, as well as diagnostic
and informational output to the terminal. On the last line of output ("ANGLES:"), the
docking angle and incident angles are the first two numbers given, respectively, while
the third number is distance in Angstroms between TCR center and pMHC.
